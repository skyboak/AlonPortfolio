# Games Directory

Place individual mini-game React/TSX components here. Suggested structure:

- /src/games/components/<GameName>.tsx  (self-contained game component)
- /src/games/hooks (optional shared hooks)
- /src/games/types (shared types)

Each game should export a default React component with minimal props for embedding.
