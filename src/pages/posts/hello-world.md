Devlog #1: Launching into the Cosmos with Idle Galaxy!

Hey space cadets!  I'm excited to kick off the devlog for Idle Galaxy, my upcoming mobile game where you'll become the ultimate space tycoon!

** Progress Update:**

    Core Gameplay Loop: The foundation is laid! You can already explore the galaxy, collect resources, upgrade your spaceships, and unlock new planets.
    Planets Galore: I've designed five unique planets with distinct resources and visual themes, each offering exciting challenges and rewards.
    Spaceship Squad: A variety of spaceships are ready to be captained, each with unique stats and upgrade paths.
    Mysterious Anomalies: Strange occurrences are happening throughout the galaxy. Can you uncover their secrets and reap the rewards?

** Technical Tidbits:**

    I'm using Unity for development, and it's been a great experience for building the game's 2D world and UI. ️
    I'm experimenting with different idle mechanics to ensure a satisfying and engaging experience, even when you're AFK. ⏳

** Challenges & Solutions:**

     Balancing resource gathering and spaceship upgrades to create a smooth and engaging progression curve was tricky, but I think I found a good balance!
    Designing visually distinct planets while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic was a fun challenge. I can't wait to show you more!

** What's Next?**

    I'm working on adding more planets, including a special "black hole" sector with unique mechanics and high-risk, high-reward gameplay. ️
    A deeper research system is in the pipeline, allowing you to unlock powerful technologies and uncover the secrets of the galaxy.
    I'm also planning to implement social features like leaderboards and achievements to add a competitive edge and encourage community interaction.
