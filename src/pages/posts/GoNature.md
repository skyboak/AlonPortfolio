# GoNature: Simplifying Park Visits

ðŸŒ³ We developed GoNature, a system that allows visitors to book visits to parks and nature reserves. This application streamlines the booking process, making it easy for visitors to select a park, choose dates/times, specify group size, and complete payment.

### Features:

- **Effortless Booking**: Visitors can easily select parks, choose dates, and specify group sizes.
- **Streamlined Management**: Park employees can efficiently manage visitor check-ins, whether they're pre-booked or casual visitors.
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Park and department managers can access detailed statistics to make informed decisions about park operations.

### Technologies Used:

ðŸ’» GoNature was developed using Java, JavaFX, CSS, leveraging OCSF and SQL database. This integrated design and development approach ensures a seamless user experience.

### Our Journey:

ðŸŒ¿ Our journey with GoNature has been transformative, enabling us to expand our knowledge and grow both personally and professionally.
